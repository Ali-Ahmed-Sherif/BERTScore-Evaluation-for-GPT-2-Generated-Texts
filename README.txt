BERTScore Evaluation for GPT-2 Generated Texts
Project Overview
This project evaluates the quality of text generation using GPT-2 and calculates the BERTScore to compare generated text with human-written references. BERTScore is a metric that measures the semantic similarity between two texts using BERT embeddings, and it provides an F1 score that evaluates text generation tasks like summarization, translation, and other creative text generation tasks.

Objective
Generate Motivational Quotes using GPT-2 for different prompt types (e.g., Direct-instruction, Scenario-based, Persona-based).

Evaluate the generated texts using BERTScore, comparing them to human-written references.

Display the BERTScore F1 scores for each generated response in a table format.

Key Features
Text Generation using GPT-2 for diverse motivational quotes.

BERTScore calculation to compare the generated text against human-written references.

Formatted table output of results using tabulate.

Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. You will also need the following libraries:

transformers: For loading and using GPT-2.

torch: PyTorch library to work with the model.

bert-score: For computing the BERTScore.

pandas: To manage and display data in a tabular format.

tabulate: For displaying results in the terminal in a readable table format.

Conclusion
This project helps you evaluate the quality of GPT-2 generated texts using BERTScore, providing a semantic similarity measure based on BERT embeddings. You can generate motivational quotes for various prompt types and evaluate them against human-written references.

Feel free to adjust the prompts and the number of outputs to fit your needs. Let me know if you need further customization or clarification!
